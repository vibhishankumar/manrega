    <h2>Apply for Jobs under MNREGA</h2> 
<p>The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (External website that opens in a new window) aims at enhancing the livelihood security of people in rural areas by guaranteeing hundred days of wage-employment in a financial year to a rural household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.<p><br>

<p>MNREGA (External website that opens in a new window) fosters conditions for inclusive growth, ranging from basic wage security and recharging rural economy to a transformative empowerment process of democracy. It provides a strong social safety net for the vulnerable groups by providing a fall-back employment source, when other employment alternatives are scarce or inadequate.

The Schemes so formulated are called the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), followed by the name of the State.</p></div>
