<h3>4. When was Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act passed by the Indian
Parliament?</h3>

A. The Indian Parliament passed the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act on
23rd August 2005.

<h3> 5. When was the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act Notified?</h3>

A. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was notified through the Gazette
of India (Extraordinary) Notification dated September 7, 2005; it came into force on February 2, 2006
in 200 backward districts.

<h3>6. When and what amendment was made to change the nomenclature of the Act from NREGA
to MGNREGA?</h3>

A. On 2nd October 2009 an amendment was made in the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
2005, to change the nomenclature of the Act from NREGA to MGNREGA. The Section 1 (1) was
amended by renaming the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act with the words the Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (The Gazette of India Extraordinary Notification
dated 2nd October 2009, No. 53).

<h3>7. Is the Employment Guarantee Act restricted to particular States or districts?</h3>

A. No, it is implemented in all rural districts of the country.
MGNREGA was implemented in 200 districts in the first phase with effect from February 2006 and
extended subsequently, to additional 113 and 17 districts with effect from April 1st 2007 and May 15th
2007, respectively. The remaining districts were included under the Act with effect from April 1st,
2008. Currently, the Act is under implementation in 644 districts of the country with substantial rural
population.

<h3>8. In what way paradigm shift has taken place with the implementation of MGNREGA?</h3>

A. MGNREGA is demand driven wage employment programme and resource transfer from Centre to
States is based on the demand for employment in each State. MGNREGA is bottom-up, peoplecentred,
demand-driven, self-selecting and rights-based programme. It provides a legal guarantee
for wage employment by providing allowances and compensation both in cases of failure to provide
work on demand and delays in payment of wages for work undertaken. Plans and decisions regarding
the nature and choice of works to be undertaken, the order in which each worksite selection etc.,
are all to be made in open assemblies of the Gram Sabha (GS) and ratified by the GP. Social audit
is a new feature, which creates accountability of performance, especially towards immediate
stakeholders. Thus MGNREGA also marks a break from the relief programmes of the past towards
an integrated natural resource management and livelihoods generation perspective.

<h3> 9. How an amendment can be made to the schedules of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA 2005?</h3>

A. If the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so, it may, by notification,
amend Schedule I or Schedule II and thereupon Schedule I or Schedule II, as the case may be, shall
be deemed to have been amended (Section 29, of the Act).

<h3>10. Whether State Government is having any powers to make rules for effective implementation
of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS?</h3>

A. Yes, the State Government may by notification make rules to carry out the provisions of Act subject
to the conditions of consistency with Mahatma Gandhi NREGA and rules made by the Central
Government [(Section 32(1)].

<h3>11. Can the Central and State Governments delegate the powers of implementation?</h3>

A. Yes, the Central Government may delegate powers (excluding the power to make rules) to State
Governments or subordinate officer by a notification and State Governments can delegate the powers
to subordinates (Section 26).
